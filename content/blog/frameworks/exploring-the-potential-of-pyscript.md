#### 1. Exploring the Potential of PyScript for UI Development and Web Applications

In the last couple of decades, Python and advanced UI languages like modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have not worked in collaboration. Python lacked a simple mechanism to create appealing UIs for simply packaging and deploying apps, while current HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can have a steep learning curve.

Allowing Python to utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript conventions solves not only those two problems but also those related to web application development, packaging, distribution, and deployment.

PyScript isn't meant to take the role of JavaScript in the browser, though – rather, it's meant to give Python developers, particularly data scientists, more flexibility and power.

#### 3. Installing PyScript:
To get started with PyScript, you need to install it as a Python package. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:
```
pip install pyscript
```

### 4. Getting Started with PyScript:
PyScript provides a minimalistic and intuitive API for building web interfaces. Let's begin with a simple example:

Step 1: Create an HTML file, e.g., `index.html`, and add the following content:
```html showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>PyScript Example</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/pyscript@1.0.0/dist/pyscript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>PyScript Example</h1>
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script type="pyscript">
        import pyscript as ps

        app = ps.App("#app")

        @app.route("/")
        def home():
            return ps.Text("Hello, PyScript!")

        app.run()
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Step 2: Open the HTML file in a web browser. You should see the text "Hello, PyScript!" rendered on the page.

In the above code, we import the `pyscript` module and create an instance of the `App` class, specifying the target element where our application will be rendered (in this case, the `#app` div). We define a route for the home page ("/") and return a `Text` component with the message "Hello, PyScript!".

#### 5. Building Interactive Web Elements:
PyScript provides a set of components for building interactive web elements. Let's enhance our example by adding a button and a counter that increments on button click:

```html showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>PyScript Example</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/pyscript@1.0.0/dist/pyscript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>PyScript Example</h1>
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script type="pyscript">
        import pyscript as ps

        app = ps.App("#app")

        @app.route("/")
        def home():
            count = ps.State(0)

            def increment():
                count.value += 1

            return [
                ps.Text(f"Count: {count.value}"),
                ps.Button("Increment", onclick=increment),
            ]

        app.run()
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In the updated code, we introduce the `State` component to manage the state of our counter. We define an `increment` function that increments the value of `count` when the button is clicked. We render both the current count and the button in the return statement, ensuring that any changes to the state will trigger a re-render.

#### 6. Handling Events with PyScript:
PyScript allows you to handle various events such as button clicks, form

 submissions, and input changes. Let's modify our example to handle a form submission and display the submitted value:

```html showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>PyScript Example</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/pyscript@1.0.0/dist/pyscript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>PyScript Example</h1>
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script type="pyscript">
        import pyscript as ps

        app = ps.App("#app")

        @app.route("/")
        def home():
            name = ps.State("")

            def handle_submit(event):
                event.preventDefault()
                ps.alert(f"Hello, {name.value}!")

            return [
                ps.Form(onsubmit=handle_submit, children=[
                    ps.Label("Name:"),
                    ps.Input(type="text", value=name.value, onchange=lambda event: name.set(event.target.value)),
                    ps.Button("Submit", type="submit")
                ]),
            ]

        app.run()
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this updated code, we introduce a form element with a text input field and a submit button. The `handle_submit` function is called when the form is submitted. It prevents the default form submission behavior, displays an alert with the submitted name, and clears the input field.

#### 7. Data Binding with PyScript:
PyScript supports data binding, allowing you to synchronize the state of components with external data sources. Let's illustrate this with an example where a dropdown menu's value is bound to the selected color:

```html showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>PyScript Example</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/pyscript@1.0.0/dist/pyscript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>PyScript Example</h1>
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script type="pyscript">
        import pyscript as ps

        app = ps.App("#app")

        @app.route("/")
        def home():
            color = ps.State("red")

            return [
                ps.Select(value=color.value, onchange=lambda event: color.set(event.target.value), children=[
                    ps.Option("Red", value="red"),
                    ps.Option("Green", value="green"),
                    ps.Option("Blue", value="blue"),
                ]),
                ps.Text(f"Selected color: {color.value}"),
            ]

        app.run()
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In the updated code, we use the `State` component to define the `color` state, which represents the selected color in the dropdown menu. The `onchange` event updates the `color` state based on the selected option value. The selected color is then displayed using the `Text` component.

#### 8. Generating Standard Normal Distribution with NumPy and Visualizing with Matplotlib
We will use numpy to generate numbers coming from Standard Normal distribution and then plot them using `matplotlib`. We do so using the following code

```html showLineNumbers
<html>
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css" />
      <script defer src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>
      <py-env>
        - numpy
        - matplotlib
      </py-env>
    </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Plotting a histogram of Standard Normal distribution</h1>
    <div id="plot"></div>
    <py-script output="plot">
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)

rv = np.random.standard_normal(1000)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(rv, bins=30)
fig

    </py-script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This time, we also did the following:

- We defined the libraries we wanted to use in our Python environment by listing them in the `<py-env>` block,
- We indicated that we will be outputting a plot by specifying it in the `<py-script>` block: `<py-script output=”plot”>`.

![Visualizing with Matplotlib in a Browser](/photos/Visualizing-with-Matplotlib.png "Visualizing with Matplotlib")

Naturally, as our codebase grows bigger, we do not have to embed it entirely in the HTML file. We can use the following block structure to load any .py script:

```
<py-script src="/our_script.py"> </py-script>
```
You can find quite a lot of examples of using PyScript [here](https://pyscript.net/examples/) (already running in the browser) and [here](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/tree/main/pyscriptjs/examples) (code on GitHub).
